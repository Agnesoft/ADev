## How to contribute

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability and instead contact us directly at [agnesoft@agnesoft.com](mailto:agnesoft@agnesoft.com).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching the existing [Issues](https://github.com/Agnesoft/ADev/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Agnesoft/ADev/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch adding/changing a feature and/or fixing something?**

* Make sure the patch passes as many automated checks as you can run locally on your system (see [list of checks and how to run them in the README.md](https://github.com/Agnesoft/ADev#continuous-integration-github-actions)). Not all cheks can be run on all systems and no system can run all checks. You should at least be able to build and run tests on your system.

* Open a new GitHub pull request (PR) with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and the solution.

* Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you have a question?**

* For general questions ask at [agnesoft@agnesoft.com](mailto:agnesoft@agnesoft.com).

* For questions that you would like to discuss publically open an [issue](https://github.com/Agnesoft/ADev/issues).

* Please be specific and to the point.

#### **Do you want a new feature or to change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change at [agnesoft@agnesoft.com](mailto:agnesoft@agnesoft.com).

* For suggestions you would like to discuss publically open an [issue](https://github.com/Agnesoft/ADev/issues).

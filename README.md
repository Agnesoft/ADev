![Build](https://github.com/Agnesoft/ADev/workflows/ADev/badge.svg)

Central development repository providing shared cross platform infrastructure to projects.

## Build

All build actions are done using **build.sh** script. Bash scripts are native on Linux and macOS, on Windows use **Git Bash**. When run without any commands it prints extensive readme with all avaiable actions, requirements and used environment variables for each action. It also auto-detects the prerequisites for each action. If any prerequisites for a given action are missing it offers a platform independent installation action (./build.sh install-xxx). This requires you to have a package manager though:

- [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) on Windows
- [apt](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)>) on Linux
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/index_cs) on macOS

For simply building all of ADev you will require CMake generator, Ninja build system and a C++ toolchain, then run:

`./build.sh build`

## Projects

- [ABenchmarks](projects/ABenchmarks/README.md) Collection of benchmarks from other projects.
- [ABuild](projects/ABuild/README.md) C++ automatic build system.
- [ACore](projects/ACore/README.md) C++ basic containers and utilities.
- [AFile](projects/AFile/README.md) C++ file based containers.
- [AGraph](proejcts/AFile/README.md) C++ graph implementation.

## Third Party Projects

- [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) C++ a multi-paradigm test framework.
- [tiny-process-library](https://gitlab.com/eidheim/tiny-process-library) C++ platform independent process library.

## Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions)

All of the following are part of the **build.sh** script and can be run locally on your system.

#### Analysis (./build.sh analysis)

Requirements: No warnings produced.

Static analysis using [Clang-Tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/). Use `//NOLINT` to suprress irrelevant warnings.

#### Coverage (./build.sh coverage)

Requirements: 100 % line, 100 % function, any% region coverage.

Test/code coverage using [LLVM Source Code Coverage Tools](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SourceBasedCodeCoverage.html).

_Code coverage report is part of the build artifacts._

#### Documentation (./build.sh documentation)

Requirements: Full documentation of all sources.

HTML documentation generated by [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html). Use `//! \cond IMPLEMENTAION_DETAIL` and `//! \endcond` to remove non-public code from documentation.

_Documentation is part of the build artifacts._

#### Formatting (./build.sh formatting)

Requirements: Correct formatting of all sources.

Code formatting using [Clang-Format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html). Use `// clang-format off` and `// clang-format on` to selectively suppress the automatic formatting.

#### Sanitize Address (./build.sh sanitize-address)

Requirements: No bug detected.

Builds & run tests with [Clang's Address Sanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html).

#### Sanitize Memory (./build.sh sanitize-memory)

Requirements: No bug detected.

Builds & run tests with [Clang's Memory Sanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/MemorySanitizer.html).

#### Sanitize Undefined Behavior (./build.sh sanitize-ub)

Requirements: No bug detected.

Builds & run tests with [Clang's Undefined Behavior Sanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html).

#### Windows MSVC x64 Build (./build.sh build)

Requirements: Builds, tests and benchmarks pass.

Builds optimized (Release) 64-bit configuration on Windows using Visual Studio (MSVC). Runs tests. Runs benchmarks.

_Binaries are part of the build artifacts._

#### Linux GCC x64 Build (./build.sh build)

Requirements: Builds, tests and benchmarks pass.

Builds optimized (Release) 64-bit configuration on Linux (Ubuntu) using GCC. Runs tests. Runs benchmarks.

_Binaries are part of the build artifacts._

#### macOS Clang x64 Build (./build.sh build)

Requirements: Builds, tests and benchmarks pass.

Builds optimized (Release) 64-bit configuration on macOS using Clang. Runs tests. Runs benchmarks.

_Binaries are part of the build artifacts._

#### Tests & Benchmarks (./build.sh tests, ./build.sh benchmarks)

For each build configuration the tests are run 100x times to detect flaky tests. Therefore all tests must run as fast as possible.

For each build configuration the benchmarks are run. Every benchmark has preset requirements and they can fail if the performance of the benchmarked code deteriorates.
